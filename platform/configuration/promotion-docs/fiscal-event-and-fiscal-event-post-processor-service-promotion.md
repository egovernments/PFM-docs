# Fiscal Event And Fiscal Event Post-processor Service Promotion

The fiscal event post-processor receives a collection of fiscal event lists and after processing those events it pushes them to the Mongo DB and Druid DB. Before deploying the fiscal event post-processor build to the respective environment, make sure you have ingested the updated druid config file to the Druid DB as per the instructions given [here](https://github.com/misdwss/iFix-Dev/blob/master/domain-services/fiscal-event-post-processor/README.md).
