# Platform

## Principles

The platform is built as a Digital Public Good and follows a key set of design principles listed below.

* **Single Source of Truth -** Data resides in multiple systems across departments and getting an integrated, consistent and disaggregated view of data is imperative.
* **Federated -** Central, State and Local Governments represent the federated structure of government. This federated structure must be taken into cognisance while designing systems that enable intergovernmental information exchange.&#x20;
* **Unbundled -** Break down complex systems into smaller manageable and reusable parts that are evolvable and scale independently.
* **Minimum -** Minimum data attributes that have a well-defined purpose is mandatory; everything else is optional.
* **Privacy and Security -** Ensuring the privacy of citizens, employees and users while ensuring the system's security.
* **Performance at Scale -** The system is designed to perform at scale.
* **Open Standards -** The system is based on open standards so that it is easy to discover, comprehend, integrate, operate and evolve.&#x20;
